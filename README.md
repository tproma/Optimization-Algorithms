# Optimization Algorithms
Deep learning algorithms require optimizations since training very large deep neural network can be extremely slow. Other than applying a good initialization, batch normalization; a huge boost comes from using a faster optimization algorithm.

Here, three optimization algorithms will be presented.
- Gradient Descent 
- Momentum
- Adam
